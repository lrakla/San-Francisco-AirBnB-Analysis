# San-Francisco-AirBnB-Analysis
Analysis of AirBnB listings of San Francisco for 2019-2020
# Motivation
This project allows a business analysis of AirBnB listings of San Franciso from http://insideairbnb.com/index.html. It asks and answers 3 questions :
1) What are the busiest months in San Francisco and the price variations of the same?
2) How does availbality and price differ with type of room?
3) How does availability and price vary with neighborhood?
My blog post on medium summarises the insights for a non-techinical audience.

This is a a part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree course.
